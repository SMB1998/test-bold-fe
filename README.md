1. **Plain CSS usage on this project**:

   I used plain CSS in this project because it is a small application and to ensure compatibility across different browsers. Since it is a small project, it didn't require the additional complexity offered by preprocessors like Sass. However, for larger and more scalable projects, I would consider using Sass for its advantages in terms of modularity and code reuse.
